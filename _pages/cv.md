Skills
======
Data Collection/Experimental Design
----------------------------------
* Collection of structural and functional MRI data for three protocols from cohorts of
healthy college-aged young adults and aging populations
* Collection of EEG/neurophysiological data from healthy college-aged cohort
* Development of rapid instructed task learning (RITL) in normal and aging populations to
determine mechanisms of cognitive problem solving
* Collected protein NMR data through an end-to-end protein imaging pipeline, including
protein design, production, purification and NMR data acquisition

Data Analysis
---------------
* Latent state identification in experimenter-designed and naturalistic paradigms
  * Discovery of latent structure in neural activity and connectivity in verbal free recall of traumatic memories in PTSD
  * Recovery of task structure and characterization of latent state dynamics of cue-elicited drug craving in marijuana users
  * Model comparisons of Bayesian and non-Bayesian latent state algorithms
* Novel characterization of functional networks in the brain
  * Used the Human Connectome Project Healthy Adult Dataset to identify novel functional networks, including posterior multimodal and orbital affective networks
  * Used community detection, clustering algorithms, and other unsupervised
machine learning methods
* Graph theoretical analysis of the dynamics of resting state in whole brain FC
  * Identified and decoded prototypical mental states, their dynamics, and characteristic graph theoretical measures during resting state
* Software platform for the identification of novel targets for NMR structure determination
  * BLAST/HMMER similarity scores in conjunction with dimensionality reduction algorithms to embed protein sets into 2D/3D visualization space
  * Developed a novel method for sequence-based structure determination and surface feature characterization based on the Rosetta platform
