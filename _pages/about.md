I am a graduate student studying neurocomputational mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. I work at the Center for Computational Psychiatry at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai under the co-mentorship of Dr. Xiaosi Gu and Dr. Daniela Schiller.

Prior to joining Mount Sinai, I earned my BA at Rutgers University - New Brunswick in 2015, and subsequently worked at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience at Rutgers University - Newark under Dr. Michael Cole. Currently, I am in my fifth year in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

At present, my research focuses on computational and neural modeling of decision-making and affect in addictive disorders. I utilize diverse methods in neuroimaging, machine learning, multi-variate pattern analysis, graph theory, and computational modeling to investigate novel questions about aberrant decision-making and affective processes in populations with typical and atypical addictions.
