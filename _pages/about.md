Hi, I am Kaustubh Kulkarni. I am a MD/PhD student at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Currently, I am working in the labs of Xiaosi Gu and Daniela Schiller.

My research involves the use of neuroimaging and computational modeling to study social, affective, and cognitive processes in the brain. In our lab, we use both naturalistic and experimenter-designed tasks to investigate the hidden states and dynamics of brain actitivity in psychiatric disorders such as addiction and PTSD.
